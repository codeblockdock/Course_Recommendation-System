# Course_Recommendation-System
Course Recommendation System using Cosine Similarity
Overview:
This project is a Course Recommendation System that suggests relevant courses to users based on their interests or historical preferences. The system uses Cosine Similarity to measure the similarity between user preferences and course data, providing personalized recommendations.

Features
Personalized course recommendations based on user interests.
Uses TF-IDF to convert course descriptions and user input into numerical vectors.
Cosine Similarity algorithm to find the most relevant courses.
Supports filtering options by categories or difficulty (optional).
Fast and efficient recommendations using vectorized operations.
Tech Stack
Programming Language: Python
Libraries:
NumPy and pandas for data handling
scikit-learn for TF-IDF vectorization and similarity calculation
Backend (optional): Flask or Django
Database (optional): MySQL or PostgreSQL for storing course data
How It Works
Data Input:

Load course descriptions, categories, or keywords into the system.
Collect user preferences through input or user profiles.
Vectorization:

Use TF-IDF to transform text data (course descriptions and user input) into feature vectors.
Similarity Calculation:

Compute cosine similarity between user vector and course vectors.
Recommendation:

Sort courses based on similarity scores and return the top-N recommendations.
